# music-genre-classification

Music genre is a key feature of any song that can guide users to their preferred category. In this work,
I apply several machine learning techniques on the given data set to classify 10 music genres based
on various input features. The goal of this work is that this genre classifier can be used to correctly
classify a new music track given its associated features into a plausible music genre. A curated data set
has been used for building the music genre classification system and implementing further calibration
on the system such as error analysis. Then, several models such as Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB),
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with optimized parameters have
been used to train the data set.
